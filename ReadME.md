Strategy
The Cow Herd Game is based on the concept of Nim-Sum, a game theory strategy:

If the Nim-Sum (XOR of all herd sizes) is 0, the current player is at a disadvantage.
A winning strategy involves making the Nim-Sum 0 after your move, forcing the opponent into a losing position.
The computer uses this strategy to make smart moves.
